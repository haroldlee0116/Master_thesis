# Master thesis Matlab pacakage
 This pacakage contains the Matlab codes for the master thesis of Zhehan Li (me). 
 The thesis report is available from the following link: http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:22d1ed04-6e95-4e07-9f7b-0a9a01b5babe
 
 The pacakage is sorted according to the sequence of section (chapter) in the report. In each foder, there are two sub-folders: experiment and figures. The former one contains the code for performing the experiment. The latter one includes the code for recovering the figures in the report, whose name is determiend by the sequence of the corresponding figures.
 
 ## 1. Please download the following auxiliary functions in order to use the pacakage.
 (1) This framework is based on the KRT-structured LSCPDS routines [1], including lscpds_krt_eval, lscpds_krt_algebraic, lscpds_krt_nls, lscpds_krt.
 
 (2) The tensor operations in the KRT-structured LSCPDS routines are performed on the Matlab package from Tensorlab [2]. 
 
 (3) The boxplotGroup [3] function is used to visualze the boxplots of a group data set, along the x-axis with space between groups.
